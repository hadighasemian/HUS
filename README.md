Human Urbanization Algorithm: a Novel Metaheuristic Approach

In the recent decade, application of metaheuristic algorithms for optimization and solving
different problems is increased and various nature-inspired algorithms are designed to improve the quality
and convergence speed of getting answer. In this essay, a novel metaheuristic search for optimization
inspired by human behavior for urbanization and improving life situation is proposed. This algorithm uses
different strategies include combined searching in open and limited scope and population management
and concentration of agents in the search process. The evaluation results using a wide range of different
test functions show the prevalence of the proposed algorithm compared with other potent algorithms in
the most search spaces.
